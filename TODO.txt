TODO LIST FOR THIS BRANCH:
mdekker:
create update script and increment db version number
i see a double menu in the installer? maybe due to new menu widget?
beware when loading plugins, the database could not be initialised yet (on install), return empty array of plugins in try/catch block
create plugin_settings model and proper relations
maybe plugins need a specific order and order field in the table?
document what events are available to plugins
